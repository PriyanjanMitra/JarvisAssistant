It is a simple desktop assistant designed for Windows, developed using the Python programming language. It utilizes various modules such as speech_recognition, webbrowser, datetime, csv, weather, news, and win32com.client. The project is licensed under the MIT license.

## Modules üóê
The following modules to create JarvisAssistant:


üåª speech_recognition:
   - Function: This module allows Python to recognize and process speech input from the user.
   - Role: It provides a way to convert audio input (from a microphone or an audio file) into text that can be used in a program.

üåª webbrowser:
   - Function: This module allows Python to control a web browser from the script itself.
   - Role: It provides functions for opening URLs in a web browser, which can be useful for automating web-related tasks or fetching information from the web.

üåª datetime:
   - Function: This module provides classes for manipulating dates and times.
   - Role: It allows you to work with dates, times, and timedeltas. This can be useful for tasks like scheduling, logging events, or performing calculations involving time.

üåª csv:
   - Function: This module provides functionality for both reading from and writing to CSV (Comma Separated Values) files.
   - Role: It allows you to work with data in a tabular format, commonly used for spreadsheets and databases. This is particularly useful for tasks involving data processing and storage.
     
üåª win32com.client:
   - Function: This module provides access to Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) framework on Windows systems.
   - Role: It allows Python to interact with COM objects, which can include various components like Microsoft Office applications, Windows system functions, and more. This module is particularly useful for automating tasks in Windows environments.

üåª requests:
   - Function: This module provides various functions to interact with web resources.
   - Role: It allows Python programs to communicate with web servers and retrieve data or perform actions, making it a fundamental tool for web-related tasks in Python programming.
